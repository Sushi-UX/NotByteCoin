                //STEP #B11. Create a struc and name it CoinData. This is where the data from the JSON will come back in.
                //STEP #B12. Copy and paste the JSON url string into your web browser using Google JSON Awesome. Identify the property you want to first call and its type.
                //STEP #B13. Declare the property in the struct below along with its type.
                //STEP #B14. Then remember to make our struct inherit from its super class "Decodable".
                //STEP #B15.Go back to your WeatherManager for the next step...
                //>>>DECODABLE_AND_ENCODABLE_CAN_BE_REPRESENTED_BY_A_TYPE_ALIAS_CODABLE<<< STEP #E1. Change all 3 methods from "Decodable" to instead inherit from "Codable".

struct CoinData: Codable {
                //STEP #B20.Go to the URL string and using JSON Awesome. Identify the next property you want to call and its type.
                //STEP #B21. Looking at the URL string using JSON Awesome shows that "rate" is not an array of values so we don't need to create another struct below.
