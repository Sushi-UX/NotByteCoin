                //STEP #C12. Copy and paste the JSON url string into your web browser using Google JSON Awesome. Identify the property you want to first call and its type.
                //STEP #C13. Declare the property in the struct below along with its type.
                //STEP #C14. Then remember to make our struct inherit from its super class "Decodable".
                //STEP #C15.Go back to your WeatherManager for the next step...

struct CoinData: Codable {
                //STEP #C20.Go to the URL string and using JSON Awesome. Identify the next property you want to call and its type.
                //STEP #C21. Looking at the URL string using JSON Awesome shows that "rate" is not an array of values so we don't need to create another struct below.
